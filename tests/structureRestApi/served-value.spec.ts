/**
 * VALUE — assert the VALUE that is served, not merely that the network was skipped.
 *
 * The rest of the suite mostly checks `expect(mock).not.toHaveBeenCalled()`. That
 * proves plumbing, not correctness: a cache that returned garbage would pass. These
 * tests pin the actual data returned/stored on both cache hits and refetches.
 *
 * The last test covers what used to be the `{ data }` wrapping bug: a fetchTarget
 * served from a *seeding* fetch (list/search/parent/create/update) must resolve the
 * item, just like one served from fetchTarget's own cache. Both now go through the
 * same `{ data }` shape (seedTarget), so both work.
