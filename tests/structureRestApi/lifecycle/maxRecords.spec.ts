/**
 * LIFECYCLE — maxRecords: hard upper bound on itemDictionary size.
 *
 * A backstop against unbounded growth, not a cache policy. When an incoming batch
 * would push the dictionary past the cap, the whole client store is wiped BEFORE the
 * batch is stored — so the freshest items always survive, and no structure this
 * composable owns (e.g. parentHasMany) is left holding ids that no longer resolve.
 *
 * useStructureSearchApi owns a further id-holding structure (searchCached) on
 * top of this composable, and that one is NOT wiped by this internal cap
 * enforcement (only its own explicit resetSearches()/resetAll()/destroy() clear
 * it) — see tests/structureSearchApi/lifecycle/maxRecords.spec.ts.
