# useStructureSearchApi

Filtered, paginated search on top of [`useStructureRestApi`](./structure-rest-api). Adds a
page-cache keyed by the filters that produced each page, and a watcher that re-runs the search
when the page changes.

It **is** a `useStructureRestApi` — it creates one internally and spreads everything it returns,
so `fetchTarget`, `createTarget`, `itemDictionary` and the rest are all still there. You do not
compose the two; you use this one instead.

## Quickstart

```ts
import { useStructureSearchApi } from '@guebbit/vue-toolkit'

interface IProductFilters {
    text?: string
    minPrice?: number
}

export const useProductsStore = defineStore('products', () => {
    const filters = ref<IProductFilters>({})

    const api = useStructureSearchApi<IProduct, string, string, IProductFilters>(
        () => filters.value,
        { identifiers: 'id' }
    )

    const { search } = api.watchSearch((currentFilters, page, pageSize) =>
        listProducts({ ...currentFilters, page, pageSize }).then((r) => r.data.items)
    )

    return { ...api, filters, search }
})
```

```vue
<!-- the current page of the current search -->
<ProductRow v-for="item in pageItemList" :key="item.id" :item="item" />
<v-pagination v-model="pageCurrent" :length="pageTotal" />
```

Changing `pageCurrent` or `pageSize` re-runs the search on its own. Changing `filters` does not —
see below.

## Filters are read, not watched

This is the one thing to understand about this composable, and it is deliberate.

`watchSearch` watches `pageCurrent` and `pageSize`. It **reads** your filters at the moment a
search runs, and never watches them, because "when should a filter edit trigger a search" is a UI
decision the toolkit has no business making: as-you-type and on-submit are both correct, for
different screens.

So a filter change takes effect the next time a search runs. Usually you want that to be now, from
a submit handler — and usually you want to go back to page 1 while you are at it:

```ts
const applyFilters = () => {
    pageCurrent.value = 1
    return search()
}
```

`search()` exists precisely for the case the watcher cannot cover: the user was already on page 1,
so `pageCurrent` did not change and nothing fired.

For as-you-type search, watch the filters yourself and debounce as you see fit:

```ts
watchDebounced(filters, () => { pageCurrent.value = 1; search() }, { debounce: 300, deep: true })
```

## `pageItemList` is the current search's page

`useStructureRestApi.pageItemList` is a slice of the whole local dictionary — correct when the
dictionary holds exactly one list, wrong as soon as two searches share it. This composable
overrides it to mean *the items that answered the current filters, on the current page*.

Which is why the `filtersSource` you pass to the composable and the one your search runs against
must be the same source. `watchSearch` is pre-bound to the composable's own `filtersSource` for
that reason: it cannot be handed a different one by accident.

The item **data** lives in the shared dictionary, as always. What is cached per search is only the
list of ids that answered it, keyed by `(filters, pageSize)` and then by page number.

## Server-reported totals

Not this composable's concern, on purpose. `apiCall` resolves with plain items; if your API also
reports a total, read it out of your own response and keep it in your own state:

```ts
const total = ref(0)

const { search } = api.watchSearch((filters, page, pageSize) =>
    listProducts({ ...filters, page, pageSize }).then((response) => {
        total.value = response.data.total
        return response.data.items
    })
)
```

Note that the inherited `pageTotal` is computed from the **local dictionary** size, not from a
server total, so it is only meaningful for a fully-local list. For server-side pagination, derive
your own from the total above.

## Cache bookkeeping

Each search's pages are cached under a key built from its filters (canonicalized, so key order
never matters) plus `pageSize`. `fetchSearch` prunes before every search: a cached search whose
underlying TanStack entries have all expired is dropped, and at most 50 searches are kept.

Same principle as `useStructureRestApi`'s `maxRecords` — a bound on absurd growth, not an
expiry policy. Nothing is dropped for being old, because stale ids still render a list while the
fresh copy downloads.

`resetAll()` and `destroy()` clear both halves — the inherited item dictionary and query cache,
plus this composable's search index — so one call tears down the whole store.

## API

`useStructureSearchApi<T, K, P, F>(filtersSource, settings?)`

| Parameter       | Type                        | Purpose                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `filtersSource` | `WatchSource<F>`            | Ref, computed or getter producing the current filters. Read on each search, and by `pageItemList`. |
| `settings`      | `IStructureRestApi`         | Forwarded verbatim to the internal `useStructureRestApi` (`identifiers`, `TTL`, `loadingKey`, `getLoading`/`setLoading`, …). |

Everything `useStructureRestApi` returns, plus:

| Property / method                                   | Purpose                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pageItemList`                                       | **Overridden** — items of the current search's current page.                              |
| `watchSearch(apiCall, settings?)`                    | Watches `pageCurrent`/`pageSize` and re-runs the search. Returns `{ stop, search }`. `settings` takes `immediate` (default `true`), `onSuccess`, `onError`, `onSettled`, plus any `IFetchSettings`. |
| `fetchSearch(apiCall, filters, page, pageSize, settings?)` | One page of one search, imperatively.                                              |
| `checkSearch(filters, page, pageSize, settings?)`    | Would that call be served from cache?                                                     |
| `isPageCached(settings?)`                            | `checkSearch` for the current filters/page/pageSize.                                      |
| `isPaginateCached(settings?)`                        | The same question for `fetchPaginate` (no filters).                                       |
| `searchGet(key, page, pageSize)`                     | Cached items for a search, without fetching. `key` is a filters object or a `searchKeyGen` string. |
| `searchKeyGen(object)`                               | The stable, canonicalized key a filters object maps to.                                   |
| `searchCached`                                       | Ref — the raw `filters → page → ids` index.                                               |
| `searchCleanup()`                                    | Prunes dead searches. Called for you before each `fetchSearch`.                           |
| `resetSearches()`                                    | Drops the search index only, leaving items and query cache alone.                          |
| `resetAll()` / `destroy(forced?)`                    | **Overridden** — the inherited teardown, plus the search index.                            |

## Gotchas

- **`onError` is not optional in practice.** `watchSearch`'s search runs inside a watcher, so an
  unhandled rejection is swallowed exactly as any other watcher callback's would be. Pass
  `onError` or your failed searches are silent.
- **`pageSize` is part of the cache key.** The same filters at a different page size are a
  different search, with its own pages. That is correct — page 2 of 10 is not page 2 of 25 — but
  it does mean changing page size discards nothing and re-fetches everything.
- **`pageTotal` is inherited, and local.** See above: derive your own from the server's total for
  server-side pagination.
